This in JS:
    - it is a keyword 

why is This used in JS?
    - methods use it to access the object/objects
    - used as a reference to the object where "this" is used.

can it be used in arrow functions ? 
    - NO, it cant be used in arrow functions.
    - WHY ? : because this will refer to the window object
      (which is the global object) in arrow functions in case of a browser or 


what are the major rules for THIS ?
    - for global execution context, this will be the window object.
    - for execution context created with method call ( calling with the object),
    this will be that object.
    - for execution context created with a function call ( calling without object),
    this will be that window object.
